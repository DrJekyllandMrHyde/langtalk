Language video chat  meteor App
A newbie meteorJs app geared towards language learning. It is a simpler version of "Skype" but mainly for language learners. 


    One simply signs up/in, updates profile and introductory message, then clicks on the find partner button, which redirects the user to the select language page. Here the 
    user is allowed to click a language, redirected, and he/she gets a list of users who are also learning the selected language. The user clicks on an online user and begins the chat. On connect, the make call and end call buttons are displayed, allowing 
    for video conversation. 
    
    
    This is a very simple app, created out of need. I am planning on learning Korean and German, thus the app.. Hope it becomes one many will use.
